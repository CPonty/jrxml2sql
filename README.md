jrxml2sql
=========

Python tools to convert JasperReports queries to parameterised sql, executable in SQL Workbench.

Project on hold - superseded by an internal tool under development for my employer (GBST). 

The new project is a webserver supporting webservice calls and a "google translate" style browser page. Will use jrxml2sql as a "Proof of concept" reference.
